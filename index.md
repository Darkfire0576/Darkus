```markdown
# getgenv() <-- this is what we use to create variables- 
# -that can be called from any script executed by [Synapse X](https://x.synapse.to/).

- t_Enabled = getgenv().Triggerbot = trigger_Enabled = true/false?
# t_Enabled is equal to "getgenv().Triggerbot" which is a universal variable-
# -that holds "true or false". The name is self-explanatory, enables/disables the triggerbot.
